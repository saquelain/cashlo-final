              Cashlo was built on a simple observation: for millions of
              people in rural and semi-urban India, the nearest ATM or bank
              branch is often kilometers away — but the nearest kirana store
              almost never is.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through UPI CashPoint, we turn that neighborhood store into a
              trusted cash withdrawal point, letting customers access their
              own money with just a UPI app — no card, no branch visit, no
              waiting.
